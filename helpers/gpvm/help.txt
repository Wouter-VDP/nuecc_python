1. RunSubrun.py
Creates the txt files needed for POT counting using zarko's tool

2. ZarkoCaller.py
Needs to be run using python 2.7. 
Creates a txt file documenting the POT counting

3. RootLoader.py
Loads the samples 

4. Merger.py
Reworks the samples and output to a nu/train sample with correct scaling
This takes as input the nue/nu/filter/train samples. No single event is lost and easy for plotting.
The scaling corresponds to 1e21 but can be tuned.
If we would want to be able to split run1 and run3 for plots, some extra work is needed here.

Note, if the files are in davidc folder, create symlinks: 
/run3>for FILE in /uboone/data/users/davidc/searchingfornues/v08_00_00_25/cc0pinp/1205/*G*.root; do ln -s "$FILE"; done

Note: pyhomereset, miniconda for uproot env
